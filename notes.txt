When do we ask the server for new messages?

What is polling?
- make a get request every so often
- polling rate: the amount of time in which another get request is made 

What is a socket?
- an opening or hollow that forms a holder for data
- an opening in a computer system which a developer can connect to 
so they can send an recieve data
- a holder for a connection on a network of computers 
- A network socket is a software structure within a network node of a computer 
network that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the 
network. The structure and properties of a socket are defined by an application 
programming interface for the networking architecture
- WebSockets allow continuous two way communication between a user's browser and a server

Sockets vs Polling:
- sockets open a channel between a web browswer and a server
- communication is bidirectional (server & client) when using a socket 
- sockets allow the client to know when the server has been updated so it no longer needs to guess (un-like polling)

WebSockets:
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket
- https://github.com/websockets/ws
- a protocol, a way of sending messages over the internet 
- When a websocket emits an event, it just sends it to whatever client is listening on the socket 
- 

Socket io:
- https://socket.io/docs/v4/
- popular node package that allows the use of websockets on both the client and server side 
- a library that allows dvelopers to do real time bi-directional communication between the browser
and the srver 
- consists of a Node.js server and a JavaScript client library for the browser
- server must connected to and send messages to multiple clients
